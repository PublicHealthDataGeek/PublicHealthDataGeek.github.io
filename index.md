I am studying for a PhD in Data Analytics and Society at the University of Leeds in the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). The Economic and Social Research Council has funded the [Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/study-training/datacdt/) with the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool. It brings together social science with computing, mathematics and natural sciences. My four year integrated PhD and MSc one of 56 currently being undertaken within the Centre.

Prior to starting the PhD I was in the middle of training to be a [Consultant in Public Health](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/public-health/roles-public-health/public-health-consultants-and-specialists). This Integrated PhD and MSc is a fantastic opportunity for me to develop my academic skills, knowledge and experience as well as having extensive training on big data and data analytics and greater subject-specific expertise. After these four years, I will return to finish my Consultant in Public Health training. When I qualify in Public Health, I intend to utilise my PhD and specialise in the public health areas of big data, data analytics and active travel.

## My PhD

My PhD involve looking at the evaluation of cycling infrastructure on cyclist safety and participation. My main supervisor is [Dr Roger Beecham](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1003/dr-roger-beecham). This is of particular interest to me as it involves cycling, big data and addressing issues of great public health importance including: - air pollution - climate change - health consequences of obesity and lack of exercise such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease etc - wellbeing - road safety

## My Research

I have published two papers of my research so far:

-   Tait C, Beecham R, Lovelace R, Barber S. 2022. Is cycling infrastructure in London safe and equitable? Evidence from the cycling infrastructure database. Journal of Transport and Health. **26** <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2022.101369>

-   Tait C, Beecham R, Lovelace R, Barber S. 2023. Contraflows and cycling safety: Evidence from 22 years of data involving 508 one-way streets. Accident Analysis & Prevention. 179, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2022.106895>

And have contributed to these other papers during my PhD:

-   Beecham R, Yang Y, Tait C, Lovelace R. 2022. Connected bikeability in London: which localities are better connected by bike and does this matter?. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science. <https://doi.org/10.1177/239980832311651>
