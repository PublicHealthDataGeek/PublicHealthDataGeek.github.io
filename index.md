About me
--------

I am studying for a PhD in Data Analytics and Society at the University of Leeds in the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/).  The Economic and Social Research Council has funded the [Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/study-training/datacdt/) with the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool. It brings together social science with computing, mathematics and natural sciences.  My four year integrated PhD and MSc one of 56 currently being undertaken within the Centre.     

Prior to starting the PhD I was in the middle of training to be a [Consultant in Public Health](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/public-health/roles-public-health/public-health-consultants-and-specialists).  This Integrated PhD and MSc is a fantastic opportunity for me to develop my academic skills, knowledge and experience as well as having extensive training on big data and data analytics and greater subject-specific expertise.  After these four years, I will return to finish my Consultant in Public Health training.  When I qualify in Public Health, I intend to utilise my PhD and specialise in the public health areas of big data, data analytics and active travel.



My PhD
------
My PhD will involve looking at the impact of investment in cycling infrastructure on the normalisation of cycling in London. My main supervisor is [Dr Roger Beecham](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/r.beecham).  This is of particular interest to me as it involves cycling (my passion), big data and addressing issues of great public health importance including:
  - air pollution
  - climate change
  - health consequences of obesity and lack of exercise such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease etc
  - wellbeing
  - road safety



My Current Projects
-------------------
My current projects are associated with the modules I am doing in the Masters in Data Analytics.  

### 1. Programming for the Social Sciences.  
Assessment 1 involved learning about and coding an Agent Based Model of a flock of sheep nibbling grass in a field.
