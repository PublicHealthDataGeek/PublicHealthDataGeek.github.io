About me
--------

I am studying for a PhD in Data Analytics in Society at the University of Leeds in the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics] (https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/study-training/datacdt/).

I am doing this as part of my training to be a [Consultant in Public Health](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/public-health/roles-public-health/public-health-consultants-and-specialists).


My PhD will involve looking at the impact of investment in cycling infrastructure on the normalisation of cycling in London. My main supervisor is [Dr Roger Beecham](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/r.beecham).
