##Sheep eating grass
------------------

This simulation shows a flock of sheep eating grass in a field.  They eat, move and share the grass with other members of the flock.  The default parameters are 20 sheep that move and eat 40 times.  It was produced for a module on MSc in Data Analytics course at the University of Leeds. 

###Getting started
####Installing
Download the following files into a directory:
- SheepABMFinal.py
- agentframework.py
- in.txt

These are the model, agents (sheep) and the data file for the environment respectively.  

Run 'SheepABMFinal.py' from the command line and the model should start to run.  

You can alter the number of sheep by changing the `num_of_agents` and alter how often they move and eat by changing the `num_of_iterations`.
