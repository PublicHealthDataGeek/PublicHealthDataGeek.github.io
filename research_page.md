My current projects are associated with the modules I am doing in the Masters in Data Analytics and Society at the University of Leeds. 



## 1. Programming for the Social Sciences.  
This module introduced computer programming in Python and use of Jupyter Notebook.  This was my first experiece of computer programming.  
The first assessment involved learning about and coding Agent Based Models.  The example used is a flock of sheep nibbling grass in a field. The second assessment required me to build a program that reads in some data, processes it in some way, displays the results and writse the results to file.  I utilised an example project that looked at the epidemiology of The Black Death. 



### Assessment 1: Sheep eating grass
------------------
This simulation is an Agent Based Model that shows a flock of sheep eating grass in a field.  They eat, move and share the grass with other members of the flock.  The default parameters are 20 sheep that move and eat 40 times.  

#### Getting started
Download the following files into a directory:
 - [The Model](/docs/SheepABMFinal.py)
 - [The Sheep](/docs/agentframework.py)
 - [The Dataset](/docs/in.txt)

These are the model, agents (sheep) and the data file for the environment respectively.  Run 'SheepABMFinal.py' from the command line and the model should start to run.  
You can alter the number of sheep by changing the `num_of_agents` and alter how often they move and eat by changing the `num_of_iterations`.

### Assessment 2: The Black Death
------------------
This program imports and reads data on average rats caught and population density.  An equation is used to calculate the average number of human deaths from the Black Death and its outputs are saved to file.  Images of the data are generated and displayed. A Graphical User Interface allows the user to alter the parameters of the equation.   

#### Getting started
Download the following files into a new directory:
 - [The Black Death Jupyter notebook](/docs/P4SS Ass2 Final Jupy.ipynb)

Go to the below webpage and download the death.rats.txt and death.parishes.txt files and put them in the folder with the Jupyter notebook:
[Black Death Project](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/assessment2/death.html)

These are the datafiles and Jupyter notebook than enables you to run the program.  Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions within it to run the code.  

Should you wish to run it from a Python file then please download this file:  

- [Python code](/docs/P4SSAss2Final.py)

#### Built with
 Spyder 3.3.1 IDE running Python 3.7.0 and Jupyter Notebook (python36).

## 2. Transport for Data Science.  
This module introduced Transport Data Science and R.  
Here is the code for my assignment [code Rmd](/docs/940065422 TDS main report.Rmd).
And the html of it [html TDS](/docs/940065422_TDS_main_report.html).
This file contains the code for interactive map versions of the figures in the assignment [Interactive map code] (/docs/940065422 Interactive map code.R). 




I created the below interactive maps as part of the assignment.
