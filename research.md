My current projects are associated with the modules I am doing in the Masters in Data Analytics. 



## 1. Programming for the Social Sciences.  
Assessment 1 involved learning about and coding an Agent Based Model of a flock of sheep nibbling grass in a field.  



### Sheep eating grass
------------------

This simulation shows a flock of sheep eating grass in a field.  They eat, move and share the grass with other members of the flock.  The default parameters are 20 sheep that move and eat 40 times.  It was produced for a module on MSc in Data Analytics course at the University of Leeds. 

#### Getting started
Download the following files into a directory:
 - [The Model](/docs/SheepABMFinal.py)
 - [The Sheep](/docs/agentframework.py)
 - [The Dataset](/docs/in.txt)

These are the model, agents (sheep) and the data file for the environment respectively.  Run 'SheepABMFinal.py' from the command line and the model should start to run.  
You can alter the number of sheep by changing the `num_of_agents` and alter how often they move and eat by changing the     `num_of_iterations`.
